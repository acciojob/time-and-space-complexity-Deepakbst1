	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they complete faster even for larger inputs. Optimizing time complexity is essential for improving the overall performance of programs.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the memory usage of an algorithm. It measures the amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size. An algorithm with lower space complexity uses less memory, making it more efficient in terms of memory usage. Notably, space complexity is often denoted using the Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.

        Both time and space complexity play crucial roles in algorithm design, and optimizing them leads to more efficient and scalable solutions for various computational problems.
